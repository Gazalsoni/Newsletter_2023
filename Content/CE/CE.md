Our vision is to prepare every student for the construction industry and for that our faculty keep updating their knowledge by attending conferencing / workshops / seminars and also contributing to the knowledge pool by conducting research. Our department is committed to providing students with a strong, broad-based fundamental engineering education, using cutting edge technologies and modern equipment. That coupled with dedicated efforts of staff and faculty results in excellent outcomes, which make our students shine in every nook and corner of this planet.
</p>

<p align=justify>
We also impart entrepreneurial skills to students through summer internships/workshops, so that they would drive the spirit of growth of our economy and would be able to generate employment opportunities for other qualified and skilled people.
</p>
<p align=justify>
I ensure on behalf of my faculty colleagues and staff that we will continue to strive for greater heights in teaching and research that is relevant and shall help in nation-building.
