  As the next year unfolds, I would like to pause and reflect on a number of important and exciting developments of our college. The college has made tremendous progress in all areas-academic, non-academics, capacity building relevant to staff and students. It is a matter of great pride and satisfaction for Guru Nanak Dev Engineering College to bring out the Newsletter 2023 (volume11). It showcases how GNDEC is on continuous journey of knowledge enrichment and career growth. It is a reflection of our achievement in hitting the right notes for the multifaceted growth of our learning partners. The events that are organized in the departments concentrate on molding the caliber of the students. We also work on creating young active citizens who feels highly responsible towards society. The way to access this key is by participating actively. I am confident that the issue of Newsletter 2023 will send a positive signal to the faculty, staff and the students who are interested in the Technical education and Technology based activities. I congratulate the Editorial Board of Newsletter 2023 who have played wonderful role in accomplishing the task in record time. The multi-partner involvement of each and every one has shown a great result.
  With these words, I wish you all would enjoy reading the Newsletter 2023 of GNDEC family!!
